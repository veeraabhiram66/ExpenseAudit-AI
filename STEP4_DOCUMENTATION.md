## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Integration
```typescript
interface GeminiConfig {
  apiKey: string;
  model?: string;
  temperature?: number;
  maxTokens?: number;
}
```

### Export System
```typescript
interface ExportOptions {
  format: 'json' | 'pdf' | 'csv' | 'executive';
  includeRawData?: boolean;
  includeCharts?: boolean;
  executiveSummaryOnly?: boolean;
}
```

### Summary Structure
```typescript
interface AnalysisSummary {
  executiveSummary: string;
  overallFindings: string[];
  vendorInsights: string[];
  transactionInsights: string[];
  timeBasedInsights: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
  riskAssessment: {
    level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
    description: string;
    confidence: number;
  };
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Executive Summary Output
```
"A total of 1,247 transactions were analyzed. The distribution of first digits 
moderately deviates from Benford's Law (MAD = 0.018), indicating a potential 
risk of data manipulation. Three vendors show suspicious patterns warranting 
further investigation."
```

### Vendor Analysis Output
```
"Vendor 'ABC Supplies Ltd' has a high deviation (MAD = 0.031) with 38% of its 
entries starting with the digit 9, which is significantly above the expected 
4.6%. This pattern suggests possible invoice manipulation."
```

### Recommendations Output
```
"1. Conduct detailed review of ABC Supplies Ltd transactions
2. Implement additional controls for high-value transactions  
3. Review approval processes for amounts starting with digits 7-9
4. Consider quarterly Benford's Law monitoring"
```
